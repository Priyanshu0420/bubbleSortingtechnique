# Bubble Sort in Java

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in Java.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

The program allows the user to:
- Input the size of an array.
- Enter array elements.
- Sort the array using Bubble Sort in ascending order.
- Print the sorted array.

Bubble Sort repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Itâ€™s easy to understand but not efficient for large datasets due to its **O(nÂ²)** time complexity.
